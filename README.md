## Decentralised Unique user Identification
*Given Below are Just Solutions as there was no sufficient time to Write about the Research.*

## Solution #1
### Unique Face Recognition Data Set through a Photo or video capture mechanism. 
Building an App that captures faces and connects that to Unique Face Recogniser through AI or ML and Finding The Data points Which Determine Unique Facial Features and will cross-check through the database whether there are any similar IDs.

Another safety feature that must be added is a unique posture or Gesture visual query Required while capturing the video (like The user has to capture their photo while  showing A finger pointing towards their face or a Hi-Fi symbol beside his face.
This prevents form people from using others' photos or faces for identification.


#### Problems with this Solution.
- Though this is highly Effective in Preventing a user from creating multiple wallets, this is very complex to implement. 
- Users are insecure about taking their images. And usually, people stay away from it.

#### Then How should it Be used?
As it is a very high effective Solution, We can use it if the user identification is Crucial. So this can be used while Dealing with a small group of Essential users. 
Ex. While small scale voting and quadratic funding this can be implimented.
