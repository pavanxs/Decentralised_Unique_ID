# Decentralised_Unique_ID
## Decentralised Unique user Identification
*Given Below are Just Solutions as there was insufficient time to Write about the Research.*

## Solution #1
### Unique Face Recognition Data Set through a Photo or video capture mechanism. 
Building an App that captures faces and connects that to Unique Face Recogniser through AI or ML and Finding The Data points Which Determine Unique Facial Features and will cross-check through the database whether there are any similar IDs.

   Another safety feature that must be added is a unique posture or Gesture visual query Required while capturing the video (like The user has to capture their photo while  showing A finger pointing towards their face or a Hi-Fi symbol beside his face.
This prevents form people from using others' photos or faces for identification.


#### Problems with this Solution.
- Though this is highly Effective in Preventing a user from creating multiple wallets, this is very complex to implement. 
- Users are insecure about taking their images. And usually, people stay away from it.

#### Then How should it Be used?
As it is a very high effective Solution, We can use it if the user identification is Crucial. So this can be used while Dealing with a small group of Essential users. 
Ex. While small scale voting and quadratic funding this can be implimented.

## Solution #2
### Building a Mobile app 
Authentication through a mobile phone makes the whole process 
This is one of the achievable ways to decrease Duplicate Accounts 
- We can implement for our users as most have just one mobile phone; by default, you can install one app on a single phone. 
- Also, implementing an IP tracker and Device identification tracker in the app permanently eliminates the access to the users' second phones wallet.

We can use this for large users without worrying about A person creating a large no of accounts and creating a Sybil attack.

*in my opinion We have to use Both or create the app for both Second Solution is for general use. The first Solution is for specific use.*

#### This is better than-

 
### Integrating Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, and other Centralised apps. 
Integrating Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, and other Centralised apps Defeats the purpose of the WEB3 landscape and Being Decentralised by still connecting back to a central entity.

### Using Country-based Identification Card.
- using Identification Card is a bad idea due to many reasons 
- People can easily create a fake one.
- People from underdeveloping countries cannot have access to one.
- And getting and implementing the data for all countries is a big hassle.

## What will I do in this project? 
- I will perform User Research to develop better solutions for this project. 
- I will work on creating a Good UI/UX for this project.
- I am willing to work with any team to implement my idea.
